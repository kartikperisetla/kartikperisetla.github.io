Natural Language Processing framework written in python to extract definitional sentences about real world named entities from large datasets like Wikipedia and ClueWeb. The core of the framework is based on the filters, transformations, parsers, feature extractors, samplers and modelers you use. Thus it is extensible and customizable for your needs. All you need to do is extend the base functionality and write your own filters, transformations, parsers, feature extractors, samplers and modelers specific for your NLP task or datasource.
