Among top 12 teams that got selected from a pool of 535 teams for Microsoft Research AI School.

Our goal was to leverage deep learning methods for knowledge extraction leveraging ontological constrainsts from Satori knowledge graph. We used bi-directional LSTMs to capture semantic context and Hierarchical LSTMs to encode Ontological constraints in Knowledge Graph.

We were able to improve the quality of knowledge extracted for certain entity types with specific predicate relating them.
