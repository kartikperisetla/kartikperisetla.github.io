Open Source Evangelist spending part of my free time on: Sugar Desktop Environment. It is being developed for One Laptop
Per Child project in collaboration with SugarLabs. My goal is to develop Sugar Activities that helps children learn with
fun on XO laptops.

As part of this effort, I have contributed:

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4632">WikipediaHI</a> - Wikipedia in Hindi for Sugar.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/developwebactivity/">DevelopWeb</a> - it is an Activity for Web
        Development using which children can develop Web Sites through HTML, Javascript and other web technologies.
        Children can learn quickly how to develop web pages in a step by step approach through examples provided for
        each HTML component.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/oopsysugaractivity/">Oopsy</a> is a Sugar activity that will allow
        children to develop C/C++ programs, compile them and execute them to learn, explore and have fun!
