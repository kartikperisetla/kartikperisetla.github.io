Joint work with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/silviu/"> Silviu Cucerzan</a>

Worked on coming up with a Machine Learning framework for detecting whether information extracted from crowdsource web platforms like Wikipedia is worth ingesting at any given moment of time. This project was crucial component in Satori- Bing' Knowledge graph as it prevented lot of noise, vandalism, transient content from entering Satori Knowledge graph.

This framework is not only based on Natural Language processing components but also on User behavior modeling on crowdsourced knowledge platforms like Wikipedia, Reddit.
