I am an Applied Scientist at Microsoft working on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.<br/>
Before Microsoft, I got my Masters from <a href="http://cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University.</a>

My research interests spans the areas of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Computer Vision with a view to build systems that can operate in this world by understanding existing knowledge in the form of text, speech, images and videos. I am specially interested in systems that can learn from experience in iterative manner.
