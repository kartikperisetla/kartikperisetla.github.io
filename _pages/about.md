I am currently working on Open Domain Question Answering for <a href="https://www.apple.com/siri/" target="_blank">Apple Siri</a>. Prior to this, I was working on Natural language generation at <a href="http://microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>. Before Microsoft, I got my Masters from <a href="http://cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University.</a> And worked at <a href="https://linkedin.com" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> in Search Relevance and Query Understanding team before joining Carnegie Mellon.

My research interests spans Natural Language Understanding, Computer Vision and Commonsense reasoning with a view to build agents that can operate in this world by understanding existing concepts from text, images and videos. I am specially interested in Conversational AI, Open Domain Q&A and Visual Question Answering.
