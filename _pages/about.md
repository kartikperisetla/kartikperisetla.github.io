I work at <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2016/09/29/microsoft-expands-artificial-intelligence-ai-efforts-with-creation-of-new-microsoft-ai-and-research-group/#sm.018shqwa12yiezz11ei2dk822jh7h">Microsoft AI &amp; Research</a> after my masters from <a href="http://cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University.</a>

My research interests spans the areas of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Computer Vision with a view to build systems that can operate in this world by understanding existing knowledge in the form of text, speech, images and videos. I am specially interested in systems that can learn from experience in iterative manner.
