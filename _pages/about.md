I am an Applied Scientist at <a href="http://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> working on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Before Microsoft, I got my Masters from <a href="http://cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University.</a> And worked at <a href="https://linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> in Search Relevance and Query Understanding team before joining Carnegie Mellon.

My research interests spans Natural Language Understanding, Computer Vision and Commonsense reasoning with a view to build agents that can operate in this world by understanding existing concepts from text, images and videos. I am specially interested in Conversational AI, Open Domain Q&A and Visual Question Answering.
